# Neuroscience of Anxiety Lab

## Introduction
This repository contains two assignment for anxiety analysis -
- **Doors** - an assignment designated to test the correlation between anxiety and avoidance by giving the subjects different scenarios in which they need to decide whether to approach the trigger or avoid it and lower the chances of negative impact
- **NPU** - an assignment meant to measure the amount of pressure given different situations of uncertainty towards an upcoming threat

We'll supply a brief explanation on each of the tasks, and how to run the code as smoothly as possible.


### üö™ Doors
The doors task is meant to measure the approach and avoidance of the subject in a given environment.

In each round of the assignment, the subject will encounter 49 doors with an even chance to either win a certain amount of money, or lose a certain (different) amount of money.
He needs to decide whether to approach or avoid the door (by going back and forth), increasing or decreasing the chances of the door opening upon the distance from the door.
